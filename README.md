# Digital Clock Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a simple digital clock.</p>

<p>The clock is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
Tried to make the design simple, modern and easy on the eyes.</p>

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript. For instance, how to dynamically render content on the page.
The main stumbling stone for this exercise was the addition of an extra 0 before the single digits.</p>

I used the **[padStart()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart)** method for that. Found the method easy  to use and pretty straightforward for the task.
